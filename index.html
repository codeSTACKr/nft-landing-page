        Enjoy unique, bright, beautiful, and sometimes gaudy art that also gives you exclusive access to NFT tools that expand your knowledge of other NFT Projects. 
        The LYPTO community is much more than just super dope LYPS, we want to build a community that makes it easier to connect with others in the NFT space and 
        grow in this ever expanding Metaverse. We also give 10% of each mint to support organizations treating cleft lips! Take a look at our roadmap to see what we have 
        coming up and take advantage of the tools we have to offer!</p>

        <p class="product__description">LYPTO is a collection of NFTs featuring many different EXPRESSIVE LYPS living on the Ethereum blockchain!

        <h3 class="product__title">THE ARTIST</h3>
        <p class="product__description">Machi V -@ayomachi- born in Atlanta, Georgia, is an artist of many different mediums. 
          From music to painting, sketching to video editing, and now NFT creation, Machi V is expanding his talents to the Metaverse. 
          Being in the technical industry as a Cyber Security Consultant, Machi saw NFTs as the perfect combination of his technical and artistic skills. 
          His dream is to work with NFTs and Blockchain initiatives full time. With this being his first NFT collection, Machi hopes LYPTO can turn his dream into reality.</p>

      <article class="Roots and Purpose">
        <img src="images/Products/lypPurplePuckerSmoke_Website.png" alt="" class="product__image">
        <h3 class="product__title">ROOTS & PURPOSE</h3>
        <p class="product__description">This project began with a goal to make art that was cool, unique, and fun! 
          The artist, Machi V, has seen hundreds of copy cat projects in the NFT space and aimed to make something different. 

          Random Person: “So why LYPS??” 
          Machi V: “Honestly, I just think they’re cool. As an artist I’ve always thought the human body was the greatest work of art created. 
          The uniqueness, the curves and the stature of the human body 	has always been fun to draw or paint. The face was always my favorite to draw. 
          Creating LYPS seemed perfect for an NFT collection. The possibilities are endless. Your LYPS show so much expression and can be used creatively through lypstick, 
          types of teeth, and jewelry like piercings and grills, just to give a few examples. So much attitude can be given off through someones LYPS/mouth 
          and I want to capture that in my art. Okay, let me stop talking about lyps so much before I make it weird, if I haven’t already.” 
        
        Our team is super excited to give the LYPTO community a chance to have ownership of their own unique LYP as well as valuable utiliy along with it! </p>
